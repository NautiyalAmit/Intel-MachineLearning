# Intel-MachineLearning
Supervised learning algorithms Key concepts like under- and over-fitting, regularization, and cross-validation How to identify the type of problem to be solved, choose the right algorithm, tune parameters, and validate a model

## basic data science toolset: 
- Jupyter Notebook* for interactive coding
- NumPy, SciPy, and pandas for numerical computation
- Matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn* for machine learning libraries.
